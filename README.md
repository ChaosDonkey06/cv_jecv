## Research interest
Main research interest are how pathogen populations interact at multiple spatial and biological scales with humans and human populations. How does this translate to human population health on relatively short time scales. And how pathogen populations fate are shaped by it's interactions with humans and the environment. Or, in one sentence, the ecology and evolution of pathogens and the epidemiology of infectious diseases. I'm also interested in how can we design or help/guide design better tools to detect pathogens in humans.

On all the set of possible pathogens I'm mostly, probably by chance, interested in pathogenic bacteria and in viruses transmitted by vectors. Broad interests are theoretical and mathematical biology and epidemiology using applied mathematics and data-sciences approaches.

Tools *(mostly)*: mathematical modeling (theory), non-linear dynamics, stochastic models, parameter estimation via simulation based inference (inverse problems), Data assimilation and Bayesian inference.
